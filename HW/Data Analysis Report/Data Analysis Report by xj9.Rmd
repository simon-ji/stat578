## Introduction

Marijuana (fromally cannabis) is a psychoactive drug from the Cannabis plant used for medical or recreational purposes. The immediate desired effects from consuming cannabis include relaxation and euphoria (the "high" or "stoned" feeling), a general change in perception, heightened mood, and an increase in appetite. Due to this characteristic, it is the most widely used illegal drugs in the world.  In 2013, between 128 and 232 million people used Marijuana (2.7% to 4.9% of the global population between the ages of 15 and 65). The short-term side effects by Marijuana  may include a decrease in short-term memory, impaired motor skills, red eyes, and feelings of paranoia or anxiety. Long-term side effects may include addiction, decreased mental ability in those who started regular use as teenagers, and behavioral problems in children whose mothers used marijuana during pregnancy. Due to this reason,  the possession, use, and cultivation of cannabis is illegal in most countries of the world. [^1]
